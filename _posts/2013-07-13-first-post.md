# Pages Markdown Test

This is a test of markdown, jekyll and github pages.  It seems pretty cool but I need to try out the workflow to determine if it's really a platform worth moving towards.

The writing in markdown really is nice.  Now let's see how it generates!

* Jekyll
	* generates site structure dynamically
	* works well with markdown, textile, etc
* Markdown
	* allows you to focus on writing
	* converts to html
* github pages
	* who needs a web server?
